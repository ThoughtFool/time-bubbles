## The Challenge

Build a game that allows players to eliminate enemy threats in two ways.
| Plasma Cannon | Time Bubble Bomb |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| eliminates single enemy | eliminates multiple enemies |
| destroys at current level | transports to next level |
So, even though the Plasma Cannon is less effecient at eliminating threats, those threats will not come back to bite you later. The Time Bubble Bomb should be used as a last resort. The essential message of this game challenge is save the future by thwarting the elure of procratination.
